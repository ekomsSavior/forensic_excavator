16   testimony that you're going to hear today will include

17   hearsay.   As you know, that means that the witness will not

19   she'll also be reporting what others have told her and what

20   she has read in reports and documents prepared by others.

21              Hearsay evidence is admissible in these grand jury

22   proceedings and you're free to rely on it in determining

23   whether there is probable cause to indict any proposed

24   defendants, if we end up returning to present a proposed

25   indictment.

 3       A.    She said because it didn't matter.        He didn't care

 4   how old they were as long as they weren't over 18.

 5       Q.     Why did she think he didn't care about whether the

6    girls were over 18 or not?

 7       A.    Because she said he had preferred under 18 and

8    that's what he wanted her to bring.

9        Q.     Why did she think that that was what he preferred?

10        A.   Because that's what he told her, you know what

11   like.   And she understood that to mean under 18.

12       Q.       Did          tell you how much Epstein paid her

13   for recruiting other girls?

14       A.     Yes.

15       Q.     What did she tell you?

16        A.   $200.

17       Q.     Was that for each new girl or for every time she

18   brought in?

19       A.    Every time she brought the girl.

20       Q.    And did              explain to you how she would

21   schedule these sessions with Epstein?

22       A.     Yes.

23       Q.     How did that work?

24       A.    So she would be contacted by                      or she

25   would call                 to schedule appointments.
